<!-- For this assignment I chose to focus on my High School Ultiamte Frisbee team that I played on. I was very active in this community and extremely passionate about it so it was an easy theme to pick. I chose to express this theme by making a professional page for the team. A webpage that conveys important information about the team and ways to get involved and overall who we are and what Frisbee is.-->

<h2> What is Ultimate Frisbee?</h2>
<p>
    Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport similar to football, except without a ball its a disc. It is one of the most popular games played with a disc and was first invented and popularized in the United States in the 1960's. It is played by scoring points by recieving the disc inside the endzone. If the disc is dropped, intercepted, or out of bounds it will turnover and gives the opposing team a chance to score. It is typically played on grass or turf and primarily 7 vs 7.
